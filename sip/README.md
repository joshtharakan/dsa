# Problem
We need to find the capital gain in an investment. The plan is to do SIP of a fixed amount every year for a long term fixed number of years years into any fund eg: index fund. 
Usually when we invest in some funds assuming the initial nav is 10, we purchase 5000 units for 50000 and then assuming the NAV is appreciated by a factor of 15% every year. THen we continue for 4 more years the same whereas the second year we invest 50000 with nav of 11.5 (15% increase) and goes on. We need to find the total value of the investment of 250000 (50000 every year) after the end of 5 years.


**Assumptions**:

* The rate of NAV appreciated is fixed every year
